== filmDB

This is a very simple database to store a list of films I have watched. It also serves as an excuse to learn Rails.

I am attempting to avoid using (m)any plugins and such so I can learn how Rails itself works.

To start, run ./script/server and browse to http://0.0.0.0:3000/films

/ and /welcome are the main page for my www.dbrweb.co.uk website, added mostly as a test, but may eventually replace my CodeIgniter (PHP) based site, when I get around to configuring Apache.

== TODO

- IMDB integration
-- Write simple IMDB search plugin to get IMDB tt* id
-- Add imdb-id-search form into /film/new
-- Retrive film-year and other useful info from IMDB
- Searching option for films with no IMDB ID
